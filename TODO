Todo List
----------------------------------

- Write crontab scripts for rebuilding delta and main

- I'd like to keep the search "modular" and using SearchDocument to allow other applications/plugins to get 
  their data indexed, allowing a full site-wide search for those that build/are building a site from scratch
  using the Vanilla/Garden framework (like me)

- Write import scripts to populate the SearchDocument table after an import from another or earlier forum

- Fix CCS layouts

- Lots more...
