Description
----------------------------------
Plugin for Vanilla/Garden to enable fulltext search. This is in a very early stage, and if it helps someeone
great, if it doesnt, I'm sorry... If you have any feedback, suggestions, changes or additions I would be most
greatful.


Misc Notes
----------------------------------
This plugin utilises the existing search SearchDocument table for Vanilla/Garden for providing search results.


Installation
----------------------------------
You will need to install sphinx (http://www.sphinxsearch.com/), I am testing with 0.9.9-release.

Limited configuration can be done through the Vanilla/Garden Dashboard (Plugins -> SphinxSearch -> Settings)

A sample sphinx config file is provided (sphinx.conf.sample)

I have sphinx installed in: /usr/local/sphinx

Then, the following folder structure:

/home/mysite/public_html/.......... <-- Vanilla/Garden Install

/home/mysite/sphinx/
/home/mysite/sphinx/sphinx.conf     <-- Sphinx Config

/home/mysite/sphinx/data/search/    <-- Sphinx Data Files
/home/mysite/sphinx/data/search/    <-- Sphinx Data Files
/home/mysite/sphinx/log/            <-- Sphinx Log/PID Files


Usage
----------------------------------
Install the plugin into Vanilla/Garden, setup your sphinx.conf, you will need to replace %%DATAPATH%% with 
where ever you are planning on storing your config, log and data files.

Initial and full Index Builds can be done by typing (correct paths to indexer and config file for your setup):
/usr/local/sphinx/bin/indexer --config /home/mysite/sphinx/sphinx.conf --all

Delta Updates can be done by typing:
/usr/local/sphinx/bin/indexer --rotate --config /home/mysite/sphinx/sphinx.conf index_garden_search_delta

Searchd can be started by typing:
/usr/local/sphinx/bin/searchd --config /home/mysite/sphinx/sphinx.conf
